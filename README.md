## ShelfReservedSpace
This mods allows to set a filter on a rack slot to only allow a certain item 
(also affects handlers jobs).

For it to work put the item to use as filter in the slot, and while hovering over
the slot press the configured key ('B' by default) and the filter will be added.

To remote the filter, hover over the slot and press the configured key again.
